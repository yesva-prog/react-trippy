        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <p>Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.[1] Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism.Travel dates back to antiquity where wealthy Greeks and Romans would travel for leisure to their summer homes and villas in cities such as Pompeii and Baiae.[8] While early travel tended to be slower, more dangerous, and more dominated by trade and migration, cultural and technological advances over many years have tended to mean that travel has become easier and more accessible.</p>
        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>Our vision is the future we want to achieve. Our mission is what we do every day to bring that vision to life.As a travel company, we exist to bring people together. When people come together, they create opportunities for shared experience, dialogue, and growth.Around the world, civil protests against ongoing social injustices continue to highlight the stark inequalities that prevent some people from being empowered participants in these opportunities.</p>
        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <p>As a company, we’ve traditionally stayed out of public debate on social issues; our focus has been on the work of providing a safe, respectful and inclusive work environment for all our people. However, in an atmosphere of heightened awareness and involvement, we believe it’s important to add our voices to the discussion and share our perspective with you.We truly believe that social injustice and the COVID pandemic are linked by what they represent: Both reveal an infection we have yet to overcome</p>
